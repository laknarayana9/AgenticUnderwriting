# Wildfire Risk Assessment Guidelines

## Overview
Wildfire risk assessment is critical for property underwriting in high-risk areas. This document outlines the criteria for evaluating wildfire exposure.

## Risk Factors

### High Risk Conditions
- Properties located within designated wildfire hazard zones
- Construction materials: Wood siding, wooden roofs
- Lack of defensible space (less than 30 feet)
- Steep slope terrain (greater than 15% grade)
- Limited access for emergency vehicles

### Medium Risk Conditions
- Properties within 1-5 miles of high-risk zones
- Mixed construction materials
- Moderate defensible space (30-100 feet)
- Gentle to moderate slope (5-15% grade)

### Low Risk Conditions
- Properties outside wildfire-prone areas
- Fire-resistant construction materials
- Excellent defensible space (greater than 100 feet)
- Flat terrain

## Underwriting Rules

### Automatic Decline
- Properties with wildfire risk score > 0.8
- Properties in designated extreme fire hazard areas
- Properties with documented fire code violations

### Mandatory Referral
- Wildfire risk score between 0.6 and 0.8
- Properties requiring wildfire mitigation plans
- Historical wildfire losses within 1 mile

### Acceptable with Conditions
- Wildfire risk score < 0.6
- Completion of wildfire mitigation measures
- Adequate fire protection access
